# Flagd build spec

## This repository is managed by OpenFeature  

This module contains the core types that developers can use for interacting with [flagd](https://github.com/open-feature/flagd).

Internally flagd uses the connect protocol, meaning it is compatible with grpc interfaces. If your desired language has a supported plugin for generating connect stubs then it is recommended to use these over grpc.

The package contains a single `Service`, describing the 5 core `rpcs` for feature flag evaluation (`ResolveBoolean`, `ResolveString`, `ResolveFloat`, `ResolveInt` and `ResolveObject`) each with their type specific request and response objects(`ResolveXXXRequest` and `ResolveXXXResponse`).
The final `rpc` on the `Service` is a streamed response named `EventStream`, this is used to pass internal events to the client, such as `configuration_change` and `provider_ready`.
