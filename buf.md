# Flagd build spec

This repository contains grpc service definitions that developers can use for interacting with [flagd](https://flagd.dev).

Below are the modules exposed through this repository:

- [Flag evaluation](#flag-evaluation)
- [Flag sync](#flag-sync)

## Flag evaluation

The module `schema.v1` contains a single `Service`, describing the 5 core `rpcs` for feature flag evaluation (`ResolveBoolean`,
`ResolveString`, `ResolveFloat`, `ResolveInt` and `ResolveObject`), each with their type specific request and
response objects (`ResolveXXXRequest` and `ResolveXXXResponse`). The final `rpc` on the `Service` is a streamed response
named `EventStream`, this is used to pass internal events to the client, such as `configuration_change` and `provider_ready`.

Internally, flagd uses the connect protocol, meaning it is compatible with grpc interfaces.
If your desired language has a supported plugin for generating connect stubs then it is recommended to use these over grpc.

## Flag sync

The module `sync.v1` is a service definition to provide flagd with feature flag configurations.
The server exposes 2 `rpcs`.

### SyncFlags

Flagd acts as the client and initiates the streaming with `SyncFlagsRequest`.
The server implementation will then stream feature flag configurations through `SyncFlagsResponse`.
The response contains `SyncState` which can be utilized to provide flagd with flexible configuration updates.

### FetchAllFlags

Flagd acts as the client and sends the empty message `FetchAllFlagsRequest`.
The server implementation responds with the full feature flag configuration through the `FetchAllFlagsResponse`.
This `rpc` is used to re-sync flagd's internal state during configuration merge events.

## Code generation

Easiest way to generate gRPC code for your language of choice is using provided [buf](https://buf.build/) templates.
For example, with required binaries in your path, java code generation can be done using `buf generate --template buf.gen.java.yaml` command.
